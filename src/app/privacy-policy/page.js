				</p>
				<ul className={styles.list}>
					<li>
						The categories of personal information that we disclosed about you

				</p>

				<h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Tracking User Behavior</h2>
				<p className={styles.paragraph}>
					The Company may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit
					within the Company, in order to determine what the Company services
					are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content
					and advertising within the Company to customers whose behavior
					indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
				</p>

				<h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
				<p className={styles.paragraph}>
					The Company may automatically collect information about your computer
					hardware and software. This information can include your IP address,
					browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website
					addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service,
					to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics

				</p>

				<h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Use of Cookies</h2>
				<p className={styles.paragraph}>
					The Company’s website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your
					online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
					disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
					deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
					you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
					the cookie to you.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.paragraph}>
					One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
					feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web
					server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
					personalize the Company’s pages, or register with Company’s site or
					services, a cookie helps the Company to recall your specific
					information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
					recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
					shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same website,
					the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can
					easily use the Company’s features that you customized.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.paragraph}>
					You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
					automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
					settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
					cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
					features of the Company’s services or websites you visit.
				</p>

				<h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Links</h2>
				<p className={styles.paragraph}>
					This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we
					are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other
					sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and
					to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects
					personally identifiable information.
				</p>

				<h2 className={styles.subtitle}>
					Security of your Personal Information
				</h2>
				<p className={styles.paragraph}>
					The Company secures your personal information from unauthorized
					access, use, or disclosure. The Company uses the following methods for
					this purpose:
				</p>
				<ul className={styles.list}>
					<li>SSL Protocol</li>
				</ul>
				<p className={styles.paragraph}>
					When personal information (such as a credit card number) is
					transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of
					encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.paragraph}>
					We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against
					unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information.
					Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless
					network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we
					strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a)
					there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet
					that are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity, and
					privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and
					us through this site cannot be guaranteed.
